### Intro

 This is Pepe and I am beginner with software development. I am full time software support engineer and I making my way
 to become software developer. My first attempts to learn were with C and I got quite confused by the way C does things.  
 Then I found HTML/CSS/JS where I was more comfortable to play and create couple thing with the code. 
 Finally I met Python where I can picture myself doing big things.
