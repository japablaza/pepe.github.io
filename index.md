### Intro

 This is Pepe and I am a beginner with software development, full-time Support Manager and I am making my way to become a software developer. My first attempts to learn were with C and Java, not the most friendly languages, at least for me.
Then I found HTML/CSS/JS where I was more comfortable to play and create a couple of things with the and actually appreciate the effort by looking the creations in the web. Finally, I met Python where I can picture myself doing big things.
